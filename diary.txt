I downloaded the data for apple. You can see them in the `appl' folder. It contains two subfolders. The subfolder `individual' contains 4 csv files, that are for Income Statement, Balance Sheet, CashFlow and Financial Ratios, respectively. In the subfolder `combined', I basically just combine all the 4 files into one big csv. There are two such files, and the one called `appcol' is the one that is the transpose of the csv file `all'. Of course, this can be done easily, but I am just wondering which one should be easier to use.

Or, I am wondering whether we should use individual csv files, or use combined files. You decide. 

Let's keep in contact through this diary. Every time we update things, or want to communicate with the other one, write things down in this file.

AS we discussed with members from other teams, they suggest that it is more important to compare stock price with SP500 or DJones, which will show the contrast between two trends or consistency of the two trends. We also need to find a webpage for as our template such that the page doesn't look weird. We might add a radar map, which has 5 attributes for the company that is selected. We might just add this radar map to the recommendation section (svg) as we give advice on whether the selected stock should be bought or not, as the stock is selected.

I claimed the items (attributes) that we might need to use for A stock in china in the file called "toextract.txt". I git pushed it. Please check it.
