I downloaded the data for apple. You can see them in the `appl' folder. It contains two subfolders. The subfolder `individual' contains 4 csv files, that are for Income Statement, Balance Sheet, CashFlow and Financial Ratios, respectively. In the subfolder `combined', I basically just combine all the 4 files into one big csv. There are two such files, and the one called `appcol' is the one that is the transpose of the csv file `all'. Of course, this can be done easily, but I am just wondering which one should be easier to use.

Or, I am wondering whether we should use individual csv files, or use combined files. You decide. 

Let's keep in contact through this diary. Every time we update things, or want to communicate with the other one, write things down in this file.
